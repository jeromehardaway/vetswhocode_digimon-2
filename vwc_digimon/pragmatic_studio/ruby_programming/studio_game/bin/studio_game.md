# Creating user stories and describing a program

## User story

As a gamer I want a game that accepts how many rounds

I want to play and prints out my stats at the end of

of the game

I want to be able to create a game and make unique

players and establish their health levels

I want to be able to continue playing and have an

option to quit the game after each of the rounds

## What does this program do?

This program allows the player to create unique

players with health values, will play based on

how many rounds are the player provides, and will

continue to prompt the player for additional rounds

until they decide to quit
