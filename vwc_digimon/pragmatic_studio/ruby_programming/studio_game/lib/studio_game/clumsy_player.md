# Creating user stories and describing a program

## User story

As a gamer I want to be able to create a player that picks up

damaged items but receives a boost to their health each time

encounter a damaged item so that the effects balance out

## What does this program do?

This program requires two other libraries in order to work.

It inherits from the player class with some slight modification

When the player pics up a damaged treasure item they receive a

boost to their health.
